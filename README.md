# Calculator
A beginner calculator C application

------
I made this program to retrive my C skills, To remember the basics of C (because if i forget that i am cocked)

Features
- Power calculation
- Basic math (+, -, *, /)
- Calculating the square root of numbers
- Garbage code, not organized at all
- Use this if you hate your life

Ideas: 
I will probably add something for rounding numbers, using the simeple ```floor()``` and ```ceil()```
